# Ola-Data-Insights
This project analyzes Ola ride data to uncover key insights related to ride trends, booking patterns, cancellations, revenue, and customer behavior. Using Power BI, SQL, and DAX, we build interactive dashboards and reports to help understand factors affecting ride cancellations, peak booking times, driver performance, and user preferences.
